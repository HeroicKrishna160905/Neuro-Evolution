# 🧬 Darwin Meets Deep Learning: Predator–Prey Co-Evolution in a 2D World

A Jupyter notebook simulation where evolving neural networks control predator and prey agents in a 2D environment. Through neuro-evolution, these agents adapt over generations—learning to hunt, evade, forage, and survive without ever being explicitly told how.

Inspired by real-world evolutionary arms races, this project demonstrates how divergent goals and shared "genetic" architectures can produce complex, emergent behaviors via artificial selection.

## 🧠 What This Is

This simulation explores **competitive co-evolution** between two agent species:

- **Prey** evolve to *forage for food* and *avoid predators*.
- **Predators** evolve to *hunt prey* while managing their own energy and lifespan.

Each agent is powered by a **feed-forward neural network** whose weights and biases are evolved over time via a genetic algorithm. Both populations share the same genome architecture, but **opposing fitness objectives** drive divergent strategies.

### 🧬 Evolution in Action 

The simulation begins with agents randomly scattered and behaviorally naive. Over generations, evolved neural controllers guide them toward food-rich areas while avoiding hazards — an emergent survival instinct shaped purely by neuro-evolution.
